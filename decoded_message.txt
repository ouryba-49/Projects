we are no stranger to love 
you know the rule and so do I 
a full devotion is what I am thinking of 
you would not get this from any other man 

I just want to tell you how I am feeling 
need to make you understand 

never going to give you up 
never going to let you down 
never going to run around and desert you 
never going to make you cry 
never going to say farewell 
never going to tell a lie and hurt you 

we have known each other for so long 
your heart has been hurt but you are too shy to say it 
inside we both know what is been going on 
we know the game and we are going to play it 

and if you ask me how I am feeling 
do not tell me you are too blind to see 

never going to give you up 
never going to let you down 
never going to run around and desert you 
never going to make you cry 
never going to say farewell 
never going to tell a lie and hurt you 

never going to give you up 
never going to let you down 
never going to run around and desert you 
never going to make you cry 
never going to say farewell 
never going to tell a lie and hurt you 

we have known each other for so long

never going to let you down
